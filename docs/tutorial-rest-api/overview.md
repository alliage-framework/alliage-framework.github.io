# Building a REST API with Alliage

Build a complete **meal pairing REST API** that intelligently suggests cocktails to pair with meals using **real external APIs**, **clean architecture**, and **comprehensive testing**.

## What you'll build

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have created a production-ready REST API that:

- 🍕 **Fetches real meal data** from TheMealDB API
- 🍹 **Retrieves cocktail information** from TheCocktailDB API  
- 🧠 **Intelligently pairs meals with cocktails** based on cuisine and category
- ✅ **Validates input** with clear error messages
- 📚 **Auto-generates OpenAPI documentation** from your TypeScript types
- 🧪 **Includes comprehensive tests** (unit and integration)
- 🏗️ **Follows clean architecture** with proper separation of concerns

## What you'll learn

This tutorial demonstrates **real-world Alliage development** including:

- **🎯 REST API architecture** - Controllers, services, and dependency injection
- **🌐 External API integration** - Fetching and processing data from third-party APIs
- **🧠 Business logic implementation** - Smart meal-to-cocktail pairing algorithms
- **🔒 Input validation** - Type-safe validation with automatic error handling
- **🧪 Testing strategy** - Both unit tests and integration tests with mock servers
- **📖 Documentation generation** - Automatic OpenAPI specs from TypeScript types
- **⚙️ Configuration management** - Environment-based configuration for different contexts

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22+** installed
- **Basic TypeScript knowledge**
- **Understanding of REST API concepts**
- **Familiarity with promises/async-await**


## Why this tutorial matters

Unlike simple "hello world" examples, this tutorial shows you how to build **production-quality APIs** with:

- **Real external dependencies** (not just mock data)
- **Proper error handling** for network failures and invalid data
- **Comprehensive testing** including integration tests with mock servers
- **Clean, maintainable architecture** that scales with your application
- **Type safety** throughout the entire application stack
