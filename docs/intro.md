# Introduction

Build applications with **proper dependency injection**, **clean architecture**, and **testing built in from the start**.

## Why Alliage?

Alliage makes **good practices feel natural** instead of burdensome. Get **dependency injection**, **clean architecture**, and **comprehensive testing** as the default approach to development.

🎯 **Simple to learn** - No overwhelming patterns or complex setup  
🏗️ **Clean by design** - Maintainable code becomes automatic  
🧪 **Testing built-in** - Every piece is independent and easily testable  
💉 **DI made easy** - All the benefits, none of the complexity  

## Step-by-step tutorials

We've designed two tutorials to guide you through building real-world applications with Alliage. We recommend starting with the CLI application to learn the fundamentals, then moving on to the REST API tutorial to build a more complex web service.

### 1. Build a CLI application

In this first tutorial, you'll learn the core concepts of the Alliage framework by creating a command-line tool from scratch. You'll cover essentials like dependency injection, configuration, and testing.

```bash
npx @alliage/create-app-cli@beta standard my-cli-app
```

**[Start the CLI tutorial →](/docs/tutorial/overview)**

### 2. Create a REST API

Once you're comfortable with the basics, this tutorial will show you how to build a complete REST API. You'll integrate with external services, handle validation, and implement business logic.

```bash
npx @alliage/create-app-cli@beta rest my-api
```

## What you'll master

Both tutorials teach core Alliage concepts:

- **🔧 Dependency injection** - Service registration, configuration, and testing
- **🏛️ Clean architecture** - Separation of concerns and service layers  
- **🧪 Testing strategies** - Unit and integration testing with mocks
- **⚙️ Configuration** - Environment-based, type-safe configuration
- **🎭 Extensibility** - Event-driven, modular design

## Framework capabilities

Alliage supports: **CLI applications**, **REST APIs**, **web applications**, **microservices**, **background jobs**, and **hybrid applications**.
