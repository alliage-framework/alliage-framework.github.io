# Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully built a complete CLI application with Alliage.

You started with a simple "Hello, World!" and ended up with a multilingual greeting application featuring:
- **Clean Architecture**: For maintainable and scalable code.
- **Dependency Injection**: Making your application easy to test.
- **External Configuration**: For flexibility across different environments.
- **Event-Driven Design**: Allowing you to extend functionality without modifying core code.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: With both unit and integration tests.

You've learned not just a framework, but architectural patterns that are valuable in any modern software project.

## Framework ecosystem

Discover the Alliage modules that made this possible:

- **[Alliage Core](https://github.com/alliage-framework/core)**: The foundation for dependency injection, configuration, and events.
- **[Alliage TypeScript](https://github.com/alliage-framework/typescript)**: Full TypeScript support for clean, type-safe applications.
- **[Alliage Sandbox](https://github.com/alliage-framework/sandbox)**: Isolated testing environments for robust integration tests.
